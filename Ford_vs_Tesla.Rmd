# Introduction
**Ford** has been an oldest name in the automobile industry with its name engraved in gold in almost all the categories of vehicles. From sport to family cars, *Ford* has been an embodiment of success. However, with the rise of climate crisis and along with it, Elon musk, Ford got a tough competition. **Tesla** stepped in the automobile industry in 2010 and the stats after that in the stock market are worth having a look at.

# Analysis Summary
In this report, we will be comparing Ford and Tesla, on company basis. It might not be as interesting as having them race on LeMans but its interesting enough to see different aspects changing the stats of their company values significantly. We will perform analysis on following parameters;

1. Number of Shares traded by both companies.
2. Stock price of both companies.

We will dig deep down into these parameters and generate some useful insights.

## Preparing data

The first process is to cleanse and prepare data for a smooth analysis. This process is an amalgam of tasks that need to be performed for successful results. We will move along the code to be able to understand all the necessary steps.

### Loading the Libraries

```{r message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(kableExtra)
library(knitr)
```

### Reading CSV files

These files are taken from **Kaggle** data set in the form of CSV's.

```{r message = FALSE}
Ford <- read.csv("D:/Data_Analytics/F.csv")
Tesla <- read.csv("D:/Data_Analytics/Tesla.csv")
```

### Table Review

We selected 50 random samples from the tables we loaded to get a look on our data.
We have the following attributes in both our datasets. 

1. Date
2. Open (The price at which stock was opened at the corresponding date)
3. Close (The price at which stock was closed at the corresponding date)
4. High (The highest price of the stock at the corresponding date)
5. Low (The lowest price of the stock at the corresponding date)
6. Adj. close (Adjusted Close price, a more accurate value of the stock)
7. Volume (The number of shares traded)



```{r echo = FALSE}
table1 <- Ford %>% sample_n(50)  %>%  
  kbl(caption = '*Table_1_Ford*') %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "center") %>% 
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#1974D2") %>% 
  kable_minimal() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "800px", height = "200px")

table2 <- Tesla %>% sample_n(50)  %>%  
  kbl(caption = '*Table_2_Tesla*') %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "center") %>% 
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#1974D2") %>% 
  kable_minimal() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "800px", height = "200px")

kables(list(table1))
kables(list(table2))
```


### Remove the rows with null values

Any row that contains a null value should be removed as it can disrupt the trends necessary for a trustworthy analysis. They cannot be filled as this data is obtained from a third party.


```{r message = FALSE}
Ford <- na.omit(Ford)
Tesla <- na.omit(Tesla)
```

### Rounding the numbers to two digits after the decimal

Since currencies are measured up-to 2 decimal places, therefore the numeric values are rounded off to 2 decimal places to get a better understanding of our trends.


```{r message = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
Ford <- Ford %>% mutate_if(is.numeric, ~round(., 2))
Tesla <- Tesla %>% mutate_if(is.numeric, ~round(., 2))
```

### Tables after rounding off.

We will have a look at our data after some modifications by taking out random 50 samples out of our tables.

```{r echo = FALSE, fig.align='center'}
table3 <- Ford %>% sample_n(50)  %>%  
  kbl(caption = '*Table_1_Ford*') %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "center") %>% 
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#1974D2") %>% 
  kable_minimal() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "800px", height = "200px")

table4 <- Tesla %>% sample_n(50)  %>%  
  kbl(caption = '*Table_2_Tesla*') %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "center") %>% 
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#1974D2") %>% 
  kable_minimal() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "800px", height = "200px")

kables(list(table3))
kables(list(table4))
```

### Add Year and Name coloumns in table

To get a clear sense of what the stats present, we need to introduce a discriminator as the attributes for both the tables are same. Thus **Name** column is introduced for clarification. **Year** column is introduced by extracting *year* from *date* for better summary of our data.

```{r message = FALSE}
Ford$year <- format(as.Date(Ford$Date, format="%m/%d/%Y"),"%Y")
Ford$Name <-  "Ford"

Tesla$year <- format(as.Date(Tesla$Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y"), "%Y")
Tesla$Name <-  "Tesla"
```

### Combining both Tables

Merging both tables to get a single table.

```{r message = FALSE}
Automobiles <- rbind(Ford, Tesla)
```

### Display Table

This is the table that will be used to generate all the necessary insights from the data.

```{r echo = FALSE}
table3 <- Automobiles %>% sample_n(50)  %>%  
  kbl(caption = '*Table_3*') %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"), full_width = F, position = "center") %>% 
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE, color = "white", background = "#1974D2") %>% 
  kable_minimal() %>%
  scroll_box(width = "800px", height = "200px")

kables(list(table3))
```

### Exporting the file for Analysis

Exporting the tables in CSV format to take the analysis to Tableau.

```{r message = FALSE}
write.csv(Automobiles, "D:/Data_Analytics/Ford_vs_Tesla.csv")
```

# Final Analysis

1. Although Ford has been in the market for comparatively longer time, but Tesla has given Ford a tough competition since its beginning.
2. The birth year of Tesla i.e. 2010, brought a huge dip in Ford's share trade volume.
3. In the year 2021, the stock price of Tesla was 693 dollars more than Ford's.

All these results are interesting enough to dig even deeper and find the causalities. This report has helped us get an overall view of the performance of both these companies and provided a brief Ford VS Tesla comparison.
